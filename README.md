## Overview

Thermalright LCD Control provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your Thermalright LCD display on Linux systems.

The application features both a desktop GUI and a background service for seamless device control.

I performed reverse engineering on the Thermalright Windows application to understand its internal mechanisms.

During my analysis, I identified four different USB VID:PID combinations handled by the Windows application, all sharing
the same interaction logic.

Since I have access only to the Frozen Warframe 420 BLACK ARGB, my testing was limited exclusively to this specific
device.

Also, this application implements reading metrics from Amd, Nvidia, and Intel GPU. My testing was limited to Nvidia GPU.

Feel free to contribute to this project and let me know if the application is working with other devices.

For backgrounds, i have included all media formats supported by the Windows application
and added the option to select a collection of images to cycle through on the display.

   ```

2. **Install** the package:
   ```bash
   sudo zypper install /tmp/thermalright-lcd-control-1.1.1-1.noarch.rpm
   ```

### Install using Tar.gz archive

1. **Check** for required dependencies:
   /!\ Make sure you have these required dependencies installed:
    - python3
    - python3-pip
    - python3-venv
    - libhidapi-* or hidapi depending on your distribution

2. **Download** the `.tar.gz` package:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/rejeb/thermalright-lcd-control/raw/refs/heads/master/releases/thermalright-lcd-control-1.1.1.tar.gz -P /tmp/
   ```
   
3. **Untar** the archive file:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   
   tar -xvf thermalright-lcd-control-1.1.1.tar.gz
   ```
    
4. **Install** application:
   ```bash
   cd /thermalright-lcd-control
   
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

That's it! The application is now installed. You can see the default theme displayed on your Thermalright LCD device.

## Troubleshooting
If your device is 0416:5302 and nothing is displayed:
    - Check service status to see if it is running
    - Try restart service
    - Check service logs located in /var/log/thermalright-lcd-control.log


If your device is one of the other devices, contributions are welcome.
Here some tips to help you:
    - Check service status to see if it is running
    - Check service logs located in /var/log/thermalright-lcd-control.log
    - If the device is not working then this possibly mean that header value is not correct. 
See [Add new device](#add-new-device) section to fix header generation.
    - If the device is working but image is not good, this means that the image is not encoded correctly.
See [Add new device](#add-new-device) section to fix image encoding by overriding method _`_encode_image`.


## Usage

### Launch the Application

- **From Applications Menu**: Search for "Thermalright LCD Control" in your application launcher
- **From Terminal**: Run `thermalright-lcd-control`

### System Service

The background service starts automatically after installation. You can manage it using:

# Check service status

sudo systemctl status thermalright-lcd-control.service

# Restart service

sudo systemctl restart thermalright-lcd-control.service

# Stop service

sudo systemctl stop thermalright-lcd-control.service

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04+ / Debian 11+ / Other modern Linux distributions
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher (automatically managed)
- **Desktop Environment**: Any modern Linux desktop (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)
- **Hardware**: Compatible Thermalright LCD device

## Add new device

In [HOWTO.md](doc/HOWTO.md) I detail all the steps I gone through to find out how myy device works and all steps to add a new device.
